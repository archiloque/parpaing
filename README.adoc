This is a playground to test generating LEGO landscape.

Code is probably a mess and only inteneded for my own use, buyer beware!

The `city.rb` generate a `result.ldr` file with the link:https://www.ldraw.org/article/218.html[LDraw file format].

To see the result you can use a program like link:https://www.leocad.org[leoCAD] or link:https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page[Studio].
